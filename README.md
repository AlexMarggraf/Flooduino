-----------------------------------

Welcome to **raylib game template**!

This template provides a base structure to start developing a small raylib game in plain C. The repo is also pre-configured with a default `LICENSE` and a `README.md` (this one) to be filled with the required game information by users.

All the sections defined by `$(Data to Fill)` are expected to be edited and filled properly. It's recommended to delete this disclaimer message from the game repo using this template.

This example has been created to be used with raylib (www.raylib.com) and it's licensed under an unmodified zlib/libpng license.
